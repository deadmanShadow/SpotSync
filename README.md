# SpotSync — Smart Parking & EV Charging Reservation Platform

A full-stack reservation system for busy airports and malls that lets drivers browse parking zones (including limited EV charging spots), reserve a spot in real time, and lets admins manage the catalog, pricing, and all reservations. The platform is built with a strict Go backend following clean architecture, and an Astro + React frontend with Tailwind UI components.

## Project Overview

SpotSync solves a real-world problem: airports and malls have limited high-demand parking and EV charging spots, but drivers discover they are full only on arrival. SpotSync centralizes the catalog, exposes live availability, and lets drivers lock in a spot with a license plate before they arrive.

The platform supports two first-class personas:

- **Driver** — browse the zone catalog, reserve a spot, view and cancel their own reservations.
- **Admin** — same as driver, plus create / update / delete zones, view all reservations, and manage users.

---

## Feature Highlights

- 40 zone catalog auto-seeded on first boot, split into 60% available / 40% full by a background rotator.
- Live `available_spots` counter on every zone (computed from `total_capacity - active_reservations - rotation_hold`).
- JWT-based authentication with role-aware middleware (driver vs admin).
- Public zone browsing, so the marketing surface of the home page never forces a login.
- Reservation flow with concurrency safety (zone-full returns 409 Conflict).
- Full admin console: KPIs, drivers, users, reservations, and zones grid.
- Server-side rendering on the home page with first-paint populated from the Go API.
- React islands for interactive surfaces (admin tables, reservation modal, profile settings).
- CORS hardened to the Astro frontend origin (never wildcard) so credentials and Bearer tokens are accepted.
- Graceful health endpoint (`/health`) independent of the database, safe for Vercel / load balancers.

```

The backend is dual-deployable: `cmd/api/main.go` is the long-running local server (used with `go run` or `air`), and `api/index.go` is the Vercel serverless shim that exports `Handler` and reuses the same Echo instance built once via `sync.Once`.

---

## Backend Architecture (Clean Layers)

The backend enforces a strict five-layer separation. Handlers never touch the database; Services never write SQL; Repositories never return JSON.

| Layer | Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DTO | `internal/dto/` | Request payloads and response structures. Validate incoming JSON. Never expose GORM models directly. |
| Handler | `internal/handler/` | HTTP layer. Binds/validates DTOs, extracts JWT claims from Echo context, calls Service, returns JSON. |
| Service | `internal/service/` | Business logic. Hashes passwords, signs JWTs, enforces capacity rules, calls Repository. |
| Repository | `internal/repository/` | All GORM database operations (CRUD, transactions, row locks). |
| Model | `internal/models/` | GORM structs representing database tables. |

Manual dependency injection is performed in `internal/server/server.go`: `Repository → Service → Handler`, in that order. The `Handler` only ever talks to the `Service`, and the `Service` only ever talks to the `Repository`.

Middleware chain (request lifecycle):

1. `echomw.Logger()` — structured request/response log.
2. `echomw.Recover()` — panic-to-500 fallback.
3. `echomw.CORSWithConfig(...)` — restricted to `FRONTEND_URL`, never wildcard.
4. `AuthMiddleware(cfg.JWTSecret)` — validates `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` and populates `auth_user_id`, `auth_role`, `auth_is_admin` on the Echo context.
5. `AdminOnly()` — rejects 403 for non-admin users on protected routes.

A central `CustomHTTPErrorHandler` wraps every error into a uniform JSON envelope (`{ "status": "error", "message": ..., "errors": ... }`) so the frontend can react predictably.

---

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend uses Astro's "static output + selective hydration" model:

- **Static Astro pages** handle the home page, layout, and admin frame. The home page server-renders the zone catalog into the first paint so visitors see real availability before any JS executes.
- **React islands** (`client:load` / `client:visible`) handle stateful surfaces: login, register, reservation modal, admin tables, profile settings, and the admin overview dashboard.
- **Nano Stores** (with `@nanostores/persistent`) hold the JWT token and the authenticated user in localStorage. The fetch wrapper reads the token on every request, so login/pull-token is automatic.
- **Service layer** (`src/services/*.ts`) wraps the API:
  - `api.ts` — generic `apiFetch` with token injection, envelope parsing, and `ApiError`.
  - `authService.ts`, `userService.ts`, `zoneService.ts`, `reservationService.ts`, `adminData.ts` — typed wrappers that mirror the backend DTOs.
- **Tailwind + Radix** power the UI primitives (Button, Card, Dialog, Input, Progress, Avatar, Badge, Table).
- **Theme store** (`themeStore.ts`) handles light/dark mode.

---

## Database Schema Design

The schema is owned by GORM models in `backend/internal/models/`. Auto-migration runs on every boot, so the tables and their constraints are always in sync with the structs.

### Table 1: `users`

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigserial` | PK, auto-increment | Unique account identifier |
| `name` | `varchar(100)` | NOT NULL | Display name |
| `email` | `varchar(150)` | UNIQUE, NOT NULL | Login / contact address |
| `password` | `varchar(255)` | NOT NULL | bcrypt hash (excluded from JSON) |
| `role` | `varchar(20)` | NOT NULL, default `'driver'` | One of `driver`, `admin` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | auto | Account creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | auto | Last profile update timestamp |

### Table 2: `parking_zones`

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigserial` | PK, auto-increment | Unique zone identifier |
| `name` | `varchar(100)` | NOT NULL | Descriptive name (e.g., "Terminal 1 EV Charging") |
| `type` | `varchar(30)` | NOT NULL | One of `general`, `ev_charging`, `covered` |
| `total_capacity` | `integer` | NOT NULL | Maximum vehicles in this zone |
| `price_per_hour` | `numeric(10,2)` | NOT NULL | Cost per hour |
| `rotation_hold` | `integer` | NOT NULL, default `0` | Synthetic occupancy used by the ZoneRotator |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | auto | Zone creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | auto | Last zone update timestamp |

`available_spots` is **not** a stored column. It is computed by the repository on every read:

```
available_spots = total_capacity - active_reservations - rotation_hold
```

### Table 3: `reservations`

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigserial` | PK, auto-increment | Unique reservation identifier |
| `user_id` | `bigint` | NOT NULL, FK → `users(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE, INDEX | Booking driver |
| `zone_id` | `bigint` | NOT NULL, FK → `parking_zones(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE, INDEX | Booked zone |
| `license_plate` | `varchar(15)` | NOT NULL | Vehicle plate |
| `status` | `varchar(20)` | NOT NULL, default `'active'` | One of `active`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | auto | Booking timestamp |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | auto | Last status update timestamp |

### Entity Relationships

```
users (1) ──< (N) reservations (N) >── (1) parking_zones
```

Both foreign keys cascade on delete, so removing a user or a zone cleans up its reservations automatically.


## REST API Reference

Base URL: `/api/v1`. All endpoints accept and return JSON. Protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.

### Auth (public routes)

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/auth/register` | `{ name, email, password, role? }` | `{ token, user }` |
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | `{ email, password }` | `{ token, user }` |

### Zones (public read)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/zones` | none | List all zones with live `available_spots` |
| `GET` | `/zones/:id` | none | Fetch one zone |
| `POST` | `/zones` | admin | Create a zone |
| `PUT` | `/zones/:id` | admin | Update a zone (partial fields allowed) |
| `DELETE` | `/zones/:id` | admin | Remove a zone |

### Reservations (authenticated)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/reservations/mine` | any user | List the caller's reservations |
| `GET` | `/reservations` | admin | List all reservations in the system |
| `GET` | `/reservations/:id` | any user | Fetch one reservation |
| `POST` | `/reservations` | any user | Create a reservation. Returns `409 Conflict` if the zone is full. |
| `PATCH` | `/reservations/:id/status` | any user | Update status to `active`, `completed`, or `cancelled` |
| `DELETE` | `/reservations/:id` | any user | Delete a reservation |

### Auth roster (admin only)

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/auth/users` | List users |
| `GET` | `/auth/users/count` | Count users grouped by role |
| `DELETE` | `/auth/users/:id` | Delete a user |

### Health

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Returns `{ "status": "UP" }` (always available, even when DB is down) |



## Background Jobs — Zone Rotator

To keep the catalog feeling alive in the demo and in production, a `ZoneRotator` goroutine runs every hour and enforces a 60/40 available/full split across the 40 zones:

- It does **not** touch the `reservations` table.
- It mutates `parking_zones.rotation_hold` instead, so `available_spots` is recomputed naturally.
- On each tick it (1) flips enough zones to hit the target split, and (2) when the split already matches, swaps a few zones between buckets so the visible state changes every hour.
- The first rotation runs immediately on boot so a fresh server doesn't show all-100% availability.
- The goroutine is cancelled via the server's lifecycle context, so it exits cleanly on shutdown.

---

## Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Flow** — credentials are POSTed to `/auth/login`, bcrypt-hashed passwords are compared, and on success a signed JWT is returned. The client persists it in `localStorage` (`spotsync_token`) and attaches it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every subsequent request.
- **Token claims** — `user_id` and `role` are injected into the Echo context via `AuthMiddleware`.
- **Security rules** —
  - Passwords are never exposed in JSON (`json:"-"` on the `User` model).
  - `JWT_SECRET` is required at boot; the server refuses to start without it.
  - Protected routes return `401 Unauthorized` on missing/expired/invalid tokens.
  - Admin-only routes return `403 Forbidden` for non-admin tokens.
  - CORS is restricted to `FRONTEND_URL` (never wildcard), so credentials are accepted.


---

## Seeded Demo Accounts

On a fresh database the user seeder inserts (and self-heals) the following accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | `admin@spotsync.com` | `adminpassword` |
| Driver | `john@spotsync.com` | `password123` |
| Driver | `jane@spotsync.com` | `password123` |

The login page exposes quick-fill buttons for these credentials so the demo works out of the box. The zone seeder also pre-populates 40 zones across the three types (`general`, `ev_charging`, `covered`) so the catalog never starts empty.
