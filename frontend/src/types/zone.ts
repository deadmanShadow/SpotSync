/**
 * Domain type contracts for parking zones.
 *
 * A ParkingZone represents a logical grouping of parking spots (e.g. an EV
 * charging bay, a covered garage floor, or an open-air general lot). The
 * `available_spots` field is the live, server-managed counter that powers
 * the dynamic capacity progress bars on the home page.
 *
 * `spot_holds` is a per-spot bitmap of length `total_capacity`: element i
 * is 1 when spot #i+1 is reserved (presentation-only) and 0 when it is
 * available. The home page renders this as a per-spot grid below the
 * aggregate progress bar.
